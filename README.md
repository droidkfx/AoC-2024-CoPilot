# AoC (Advent of Code) 2024 (CoPilot Edition)
This repository is a log of solutions and chat logs with Github's CoPilot. My goal is to provide minimal guidance and a very short iteration loop when attempting to solve the problems.

There is a sister repository that exists where I compete fairly without assistance. Check that out [here](https://github.com/droidkfx/AoC-2024-Human).

## Methods

I will include complete chat logs and the resulting code under each problem. The prompt used as a template can be found in `Default Prompt.txt`

I am using Jetbrains Goland with the integrated copilot plugin. I have suggestions turned off. I will simply supply the default prompt to the CoPilot chat and paste in whatever code it generates. I will ensure that all generated code is "safe" but I will not correct any input directly.

As I understand it the copilot plugin will gather context from the project so I will strive to commit at each prompting to ensure the given context is clear.

I will start a new conversation for every problem but will reuse the conversation within a given day.
