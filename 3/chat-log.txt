Please write the code that will solve the following problem from advent of code 2024. It should read from a file called "input.txt" located in the same direcotory. It should print the answer along with the time it took to execute.

"Our computers are having issues, so I have no idea if we have any Chief Historians in stock! You're welcome to check the warehouse, though," says the mildly flustered shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop. The Historians head out to take a look.

The shopkeeper turns to you. "Any chance you can see why our computers are having issues again?"

The computer appears to be trying to run a program, but its memory (your puzzle input) is corrupted. All of the instructions have been jumbled up!

It seems like the goal of the program is just to multiply some numbers. It does that with instructions like mul(X,Y), where X and Y are each 1-3 digit numbers. For instance, mul(44,46) multiplies 44 by 46 to get a result of 2024. Similarly, mul(123,4) would multiply 123 by 4.

However, because the program's memory has been corrupted, there are also many invalid characters that should be ignored, even if they look like part of a mul instruction. Sequences like mul(4*, mul(6,9!, ?(12,34), or mul ( 2 , 4 ) do nothing.

For example, consider the following section of corrupted memory:

xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))
Only the four highlighted sections are real mul instructions. Adding up the result of each instruction produces 161 (2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5).

Scan the corrupted memory for uncorrupted mul instructions. What do you get if you add up all of the results of the multiplications?

---

To solve this problem, we need to scan the corrupted memory for valid `mul(X,Y)` instructions, extract the numbers, perform the multiplications, and sum up the results. Here is the Go code to achieve this:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"regexp"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	// Open the input file
	file, err := os.Open("input.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Regular expression to match valid mul(X,Y) instructions
	re := regexp.MustCompile(`mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)`)

	totalSum := 0

	// Read the file line by line
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
	for scanner.Scan() {
		line := scanner.Text()
		matches := re.FindAllStringSubmatch(line, -1)
		for _, match := range matches {
			x, err1 := strconv.Atoi(match[1])
			y, err2 := strconv.Atoi(match[2])
			if err1 == nil && err2 == nil {
				totalSum += x * y
			}
		}
	}

	if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
		return
	}

	// Print the results and the time taken
	fmt.Printf("Total sum of multiplications: %d\n", totalSum)
	fmt.Printf("Time taken: %s\n", time.Since(start))
}
```

This code does the following:
1. Opens the `input.txt` file.
2. Uses a regular expression to find valid `mul(X,Y)` instructions.
3. Extracts the numbers from each valid instruction, performs the multiplication, and adds the result to the total sum.
4. Prints the total sum and the time taken to execute the program.

---

There is a second part to the problem please modify the original to solve part 2:

As you scan through the corrupted memory, you notice that some of the conditional statements are also still intact. If you handle some of the uncorrupted conditional statements in the program, you might be able to get an even more accurate result.

There are two new instructions you'll need to handle:

The do() instruction enables future mul instructions.
The don't() instruction disables future mul instructions.
Only the most recent do() or don't() instruction applies. At the beginning of the program, mul instructions are enabled.

For example:

xmul(2,4)&mul[3,7]!^don't()_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64](mul(11,8)undo()?mul(8,5))
This corrupted memory is similar to the example from before, but this time the mul(5,5) and mul(11,8) instructions are disabled because there is a don't() instruction before them. The other mul instructions function normally, including the one at the end that gets re-enabled by a do() instruction.

This time, the sum of the results is 48 (2*4 + 8*5).

Handle the new instructions; what do you get if you add up all of the results of just the enabled multiplications?

---

To handle the new instructions `do()` and `don't()`, we need to keep track of whether `mul` instructions are currently enabled or disabled. We will modify the original code to include this logic.

Here is the updated Go code:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"regexp"
	"strconv"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	// Open the input file
	file, err := os.Open("input.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Regular expressions to match valid mul(X,Y), do(), and don't() instructions
	mulRe := regexp.MustCompile(`mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)`)
	doRe := regexp.MustCompile(`do\(\)`)
	dontRe := regexp.MustCompile(`don't\(\)`)

	totalSum := 0
	mulEnabled := true // Initially, mul instructions are enabled

	// Read the file line by line
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
	for scanner.Scan() {
		line := scanner.Text()

		// Check for do() and don't() instructions
		if doRe.MatchString(line) {
			mulEnabled = true
		} else if dontRe.MatchString(line) {
			mulEnabled = false
		}

		// If mul instructions are enabled, process them
		if mulEnabled {
			matches := mulRe.FindAllStringSubmatch(line, -1)
			for _, match := range matches {
				x, err1 := strconv.Atoi(match[1])
				y, err2 := strconv.Atoi(match[2])
				if err1 == nil && err2 == nil {
					totalSum += x * y
				}
			}
		}
	}

	if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
		return
	}

	// Print the results and the time taken
	fmt.Printf("Total sum of enabled multiplications: %d\n", totalSum)
	fmt.Printf("Time taken: %s\n", time.Since(start))
}
```

This code does the following:
1. Opens the `input.txt` file.
2. Uses regular expressions to find valid `mul(X,Y)`, `do()`, and `don't()` instructions.
3. Keeps track of whether `mul` instructions are enabled or disabled based on the most recent `do()` or `don't()` instruction.
4. Processes `mul` instructions only if they are enabled, performs the multiplications, and adds the result to the total sum.
5. Prints the total sum of enabled multiplications and the time taken to execute the program.

That's not the right answer it appears to be too high, is there a bug in that code?

---

The issue might be that the code is not correctly handling the `do()` and `don't()` instructions in the context of the `mul` instructions. Specifically, the code should process `mul` instructions regardless of their position relative to `do()` and `don't()` instructions within the same line.

Let's update the code to ensure that `do()` and `don't()` instructions are processed correctly before evaluating any `mul` instructions on the same line.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"regexp"
	"strconv"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	// Open the input file
	file, err := os.Open("./3/input.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Regular expressions to match valid mul(X,Y), do(), and don't() instructions
	mulRe := regexp.MustCompile(`mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)`)
	doRe := regexp.MustCompile(`do\(\)`)
	dontRe := regexp.MustCompile(`don't\(\)`)

	totalSum := 0
	mulEnabled := true // Initially, mul instructions are enabled

	// Read the file line by line
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
	for scanner.Scan() {
		line := scanner.Text()

		// Check for do() and don't() instructions
		if doRe.MatchString(line) {
			mulEnabled = true
		} else if dontRe.MatchString(line) {
			mulEnabled = false
		}

		// Process mul instructions regardless of their position in the line
		matches := mulRe.FindAllStringSubmatch(line, -1)
		for _, match := range matches {
			if mulEnabled {
				x, err1 := strconv.Atoi(match[1])
				y, err2 := strconv.Atoi(match[2])
				if err1 == nil && err2 == nil {
					totalSum += x * y
				}
			}
		}
	}

	if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
		return
	}

	// Print the results and the time taken
	fmt.Printf("Total sum of enabled multiplications: %d\n", totalSum)
	fmt.Printf("Time taken: %s\n", time.Since(start))
}
```

This code ensures that `do()` and `don't()` instructions are processed before evaluating any `mul` instructions on the same line, which should give the correct result.
