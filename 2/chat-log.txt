Please write the code that will solve the following problem from advent of code 2024. It should read from a file called "input.txt" located in the same direcotory. It should print the answer along with the time it took to execute.

Fortunately, the first location The Historians want to search isn't a long walk from the Chief Historian's office.

While the Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant appears to contain no sign of the Chief Historian, the engineers there run up to you as soon as they see you. Apparently, they still talk about the time Rudolph was saved through molecular synthesis from a single electron.

They're quick to add that - since you're already here - they'd really appreciate your help analyzing some unusual data from the Red-Nosed reactor. You turn to check if The Historians are waiting for you, but they seem to have already divided into groups that are currently searching every corner of the facility. You offer to help with the unusual data.

The unusual data (your puzzle input) consists of many reports, one report per line. Each report is a list of numbers called levels that are separated by spaces. For example:

7 6 4 2 1
1 2 7 8 9
9 7 6 2 1
1 3 2 4 5
8 6 4 4 1
1 3 6 7 9
This example data contains six reports each containing five levels.

The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are safe. The Red-Nosed reactor safety systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or gradually decreasing. So, a report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:

The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.
In the example above, the reports can be found safe or unsafe by checking those rules:

7 6 4 2 1: Safe because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.
1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe because 2 7 is an increase of 5.
9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe because 6 2 is a decrease of 4.
1 3 2 4 5: Unsafe because 1 3 is increasing but 3 2 is decreasing.
8 6 4 4 1: Unsafe because 4 4 is neither an increase or a decrease.
1 3 6 7 9: Safe because the levels are all increasing by 1, 2, or 3.
So, in this example, 2 reports are safe.

Analyze the unusual data from the engineers. How many reports are safe?

To solve this problem, we need to read the input data from a file called `input.txt`, analyze each report to determine if it is safe based on the given criteria, and then count the number of safe reports. Here is the Go code to achieve this:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	// Open the input file
	file, err := os.Open("input.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	safeCount := 0

	// Read the file line by line
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
	for scanner.Scan() {
		line := scanner.Text()
		levels := strings.Fields(line)
		if isSafe(levels) {
			safeCount++
		}
	}

	if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
		return
	}

	// Print the results and the time taken
	fmt.Printf("Number of safe reports: %d\n", safeCount)
	fmt.Printf("Time taken: %s\n", time.Since(start))
}

// Helper function to check if a report is safe
func isSafe(levels []string) bool {
	if len(levels) < 2 {
		return false
	}

	nums := make([]int, len(levels))
	for i, level := range levels {
		num, err := strconv.Atoi(level)
		if err != nil {
			return false
		}
		nums[i] = num
	}

	increasing := true
	decreasing := true

	for i := 1; i < len(nums); i++ {
		diff := nums[i] - nums[i-1]
		if diff < 1 || diff > 3 {
			return false
		}
		if nums[i] > nums[i-1] {
			decreasing = false
		} else if nums[i] < nums[i-1] {
			increasing = false
		} else {
			return false
		}
	}

	return increasing || decreasing
}
```

This code reads the input file line by line, checks each report to see if it is safe according to the given criteria, and counts the number of safe reports. The `isSafe` function checks if the levels in a report are either all increasing or all decreasing and if the difference between any two adjacent levels is between 1 and 3.

That's not the right answer; your answer is too low.
